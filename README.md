# EG - Task One
In this task, we applied some fundamentals of HTML and a little bit of CSS to add some sort of design. However, inline CSS was used rather than creating a seperate CSS file. Feel free to clone this branch and experiment with it to see what is happening under the dome!

Happy Coding!
